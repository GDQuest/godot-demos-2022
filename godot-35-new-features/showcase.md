1. Asynchronous shader compilation → stutters when first instancing effects before, not anymore. https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/53411
2. NavigationServer with obstacle avoidance → reuse assets / base navigation scene from node essentials https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/48395
3. Physics interpolation (3d only?) → we can set the target FPS setting in the project really low to showcase a before and after: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/tutorials/physics/interpolation/index.html https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/52846
4. OccluderShapePolygon → docs https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/tutorials/3d/occluders.html#occludershapepolygon https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/57361
5. Android editor https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.5/beta3/Godot_v3.5-beta3_android_editor.apk
6. Label3D and TextMesh https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/61276 https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/61281

 

7.  Improved git integration → push, pull, fetch and improved diff view to VCS UI https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/53900
8.  GradientTexture2D → https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/53234 (4.0 link but itś in 3.5 too, itś just this link has images) https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/54824

9. SceneTreeTween → amazing! We can just show a before and after on some node essential tween demo? I think we have some layered tween examples  https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/60581
10. Scene unique nodes → use learn gdscript app, UI's a good example https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/60527

11. Pinning and overriding properties with inherited scenes → https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/52943
???????

12. Create onready variables when dropping nodes and holding Ctrl (GH-60879). https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/60879 (works with ctrl to select multiple nodes, works with preload)

13. Align icons on buttons https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/57771
14. Theme type variations https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/57942
15. UI flow container (a bit like flexbox?): https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/56104
